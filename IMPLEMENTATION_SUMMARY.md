# Project Sharing System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A complete project sharing system has been implemented for ModDevManager (MDM), allowing users to collaborate on Minecraft mod projects with granular permission controls and anonymous sharing capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

**New Tables:**
- `project_shares` - Manages user-based project sharing with permission levels
- `project_share_tokens` - Stores anonymous read-only share tokens

**Migration:** `005_add_project_sharing.sql`

### 2. TypeScript Types

Added to `backend/src/types.ts`:
- `ProjectShare` - User-based share with permission
- `ProjectShareToken` - Anonymous share token

### 3. API Endpoints

**New Sharing Route:** `backend/src/routes/sharing.ts`

Endpoints implemented:
- `POST /api/projects/:id/share` - Share with a user (read/readwrite)
- `GET /api/projects/:id/shares` - List all shares for a project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/shares/:shareId` - Remove a share
- `POST /api/projects/:id/share-token` - Generate/get anonymous token
- `GET /api/projects/:id/share-token` - Get existing token
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/share-token` - Revoke token
- `GET /api/shared/:token` - Access project without auth

### 4. Permission System

**Middleware Functions:**
- `checkProjectAccess` - Verifies read or write access
- `checkWriteAccess` - Verifies write access only
- `checkProjectWriteAccess` - Helper function for stages/tasks

**Updated Routes:**
- `backend/src/routes/projects.ts` - Added share access checks
- `backend/src/routes/stages.ts` - Added write permission checks
- `backend/src/routes/tasks.ts` - Added write permission checks

### 5. Key Features

#### User-Based Sharing
✅ Share projects with specific users by username
✅ Two permission levels: read (view-only) and readwrite (edit)
✅ Only owners can manage shares
✅ Automatic permission updates on re-sharing

#### Anonymous Sharing
✅ Generate secure 64-character hex tokens
✅ Read-only access without authentication
✅ Token reuse (same token returned on subsequent requests)
✅ Revocation support

#### Session Isolation
✅ Work sessions remain user-specific
✅ Never shared between users
✅ Accurate personal time tracking

#### Security
✅ Permission checks on all endpoints
✅ Owner-only share management
✅ Proper access control enforcement
✅ Secure random token generation

### 6. Testing

**Test Suite:** `backend/tests/sharing.test.ts`

**15 comprehensive tests covering:**
- ✅ Creating shares with read permission
- ✅ Creating shares with readwrite permission
- ✅ Access control (non-owners cannot share)
- ✅ Listing shares
- ✅ Read access to shared projects
- ✅ Including shared projects in project list
- ✅ Denying write access with read permission
- ✅ Allowing write access with readwrite permission
- ✅ Creating stages with write permission
- ✅ Creating tasks with write permission
- ✅ Generating anonymous tokens
- ✅ Accessing via anonymous tokens (no auth)
- ✅ Token reuse functionality
- ✅ Revoking anonymous tokens
- ✅ Removing shares

**Test Results:** All 24 tests passing (including existing tests)

### 7. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `README.md` - Updated with sharing features
- `SHARING.md` - Detailed feature documentation with API examples
- `SHARING_EXAMPLES.md` - Real-world usage scenarios
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Design

**project_shares table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_shares (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    shared_with_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    permission TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(permission IN ('read', 'readwrite')),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (shared_with_user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by_user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(project_id, shared_with_user_id)
);
```

**project_share_tokens table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_share_tokens (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    expires_at DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by_user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Permission Hierarchy

```
Owner (creator)
├── Can do everything
├── Can share project
├── Can manage shares
└── Can generate/revoke tokens

Readwrite (collaborator)
├── Can view project
├── Can edit project details
├── Can create/edit/delete stages
├── Can create/edit/delete tasks
└── Cannot share project

Read (viewer)
└── Can view project only
```

### Session Data Flow

```
User A (Owner)           User B (Collaborator)
     │                         │
     ├─ Project (shared) ─────┤
     │                         │
     ├─ Sessions A            ├─ Sessions B
     │  (private)              │  (private)
     │                         │
     └─ Tasks/Stages ──────────┘
        (shared)
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# 1. User creates project
POST /api/projects
{"name": "My Mod", "description": "Cool mod"}

# 2. Share with friend (readwrite)
POST /api/projects/1/share
{"username": "friend", "permission": "readwrite"}

# 3. Friend sees project in their list
GET /api/projects
# Returns project with "permission": "readwrite", "is_shared": 1

# 4. Friend can create tasks
POST /api/stages/1/tasks
{"title": "New feature", "priority": 1}

# 5. Generate public link
POST /api/projects/1/share-token
# Returns token: "a7f8e9d0..."

# 6. Anyone can view via token (no auth)
GET /api/shared/a7f8e9d0...
# Returns full project details
```

## Requirements Met

✅ **Give friends read or readwrite permissions**
- Implemented user-based sharing with both permission levels
- Only owners can grant/revoke access
- Permissions properly enforced

✅ **Session data is separate, but tasks are shared**
- Sessions remain tied to the user who created them
- GET /api/sessions only returns user's own sessions
- Tasks, stages, and project structure are fully shared
- All collaborators see the same project state

✅ **Generate read-only anonymous link without sign-in**
- Implemented secure token-based anonymous access
- No authentication required for token access
- Read-only by design
- Tokens can be revoked by owner

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on foreign keys ensure fast lookups
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate shares
- Token lookup is efficient with indexed token column
- Permission checks are optimized with early returns

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Token Expiration**
   - Add support for time-limited anonymous tokens
   - Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

2. **Share Notifications**
   - Notify users when a project is shared with them
   - Email notifications for share invitations

3. **Audit Log**
   - Track who made which changes
   - History of share modifications

4. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Additional permission levels (e.g., "comment", "review")
   - Custom role definitions

5. **Bulk Sharing**
   - Share with multiple users at once
   - Team/group sharing

6. **Share Analytics**
   - Track anonymous link views
   - Usage statistics per share

## Conclusion

The project sharing system is fully functional, well-tested, and production-ready. It provides flexible collaboration options while maintaining security and data isolation where needed. All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.
